SXR
===

The Synopsis Cross-Reference tool allows to search for (type, variable, function, and file) names by means of a CGI script. Please see the build instructions for the Paths/sxr example for the required steps to start the sxr-server tool. The Synopsis website uses this to navigate its own source code `here <http://synopsis.fresco.org/sxr/>`_

Hybrid IDL / C++ code
=====================

Synopsis is able to cross-reference two distinct Reference manuals, using TOCs. 
Moreover, it is possible to map symbols across lanugage-boundaries. 
`This <hybrid/interface/index.html>`_ example shows an IDL interface cross-referenced with a 
`C++ implementation <hybrid/implementation/index.html>`_.
