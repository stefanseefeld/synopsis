Tutorial
--------

The Tutorial is a user's guide that demonstrates how to deploy synopsis,
and how to extend its functionality to adapt it to your needs.

Follow the :doc:`tutorial/index` from the navigation bar
to read the html version, or alternatively use the 
`pdf <../print/Tutorial.pdf>`_ version.
